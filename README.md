## Live Deployment

- [Lights Out Live Deployment](https://toons-lights-out.vercel.app/)

## Rules

1. Board opens randomly lit. 
2. User must touch the cells to turn on/off the lights. 
3. Each cell touches the four (up, down, left, right) cells around it.
4. Play until board is fully dark (or for now, down to one lit piece).
5. Celebrate victory!

## Future Improvements

- Light and dark mode for users.
- Option for users to choose board size.
- Create randomly generated board for that will always succeed. "Dancing Links" algorithm suggested in research.
