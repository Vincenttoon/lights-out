#Bugs to fix

- Make responsive
- Fix so you can always win:
    - "For future improvements you could change the way you populate your board, since doing it randomly doesn't guarantee it will always be solvable (mathematically speaking). Instead you could populate it with only "false" and then generate random clicks, that way you can safely say every new board is solvable."

##improvements
 - change board size for per phone screen?
 - Light and dark mode
